  <h1>Birthday Paradox Calculator</h1>
  <p>Calculate the probability of someone having the same birthday as you by typing in how many people there are!</p>
  <p>Ammount of people: <input type=number id="people"></p>
    <button onClick="start()" id="btn1">Calculate</button>
    <p>Probability = <span id="result">0</span>%</p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>First it calculates the ammount of combinations there are by how many people, then it uses the negative result(y) over 365 as the power for <em>e</em>. Heres the equation used:

    <h1>Probability of winning The Powerball</h1>
    <p>Calculate the probability of someone having the same birthday as you by typing in how many people there are!</p>
  <p>Ammount of tickets: <input type=number id="tickets"></p>
    <button onClick="start2()" id="btn2">Calculate</button>
    <p>Probability = <span id="result2">0</span>%</p>
    <p>Probability(Without Powerball) = <span id="result2-1">0</span>%</p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>It is a <strong>1/280962825</strong> chance of winning The Powerball (as of 2015 with 69 regular numbers and 25 power) and a <strong>1/11238513</strong> chance of winning without The Powerball. The equation for the ammount of combinations for each set of numbers is: <br> <span id="equation">C(n,r) = n! / ( r!(n - r)! ).</span></p>
