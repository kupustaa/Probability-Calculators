# Probability-Calculators
I made these to solve problems in my Statistics class and to help explain probability to future students in my school.
For the birthday paradox calculator, I wasnt able to make a recursion to do the original equation with the knowledge I have at this time (1/19/16), so instead I made one that created the ammount of combinations possible for the ammount of people involved, and used Poisson Distribution to create a seperate function, and then multiplied the result by 100 to get the exact percentage.
The powerball calculator I made by figuring out the amount of combinations possible by selecting 5 different numbers from 69, then having one divided by the result to get the probability of a specific combination happening, mulitplied by the probability of getting a specific powerball (1/25). The end result is the probability of having a winning power ball ticket, the function then is multiplied by the amount of tickets typed in the calculator (2 tickets is twice the probability, etc.). The second result is when you replace the probability of hitting both the powerball and five numbers with the five numbers alone. It works the same exact way as stated above.
